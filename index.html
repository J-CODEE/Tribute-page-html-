    <h2>Imprisonment</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> 1994 Moshood Abiola, MKO declared himself the lawful president of Nigeria in the Epetedo 
        area of Lagos island, an area mainly populated by (Yoruba) Lagos Indigenes. 
        He had recently returned from a trip to win the support of the international community 
        for his mandate. After declaring himself president he was declared wanted and was accused of
         treason and arrested on the orders of military President General Sani Abacha, 
         who sent 200 police vehicles to bring him into custody. 
         MKO Abiola has been referred to as Nigeria's greatest statesman.
         [42] His second wife Alhaja Kudirat Abiola was assassinated in Lagos in 1996 after declaring 
         public support for her husband.
        Moshood Abiola was detained for four years, largely in solitary confinement with a Bible, Qur'an, 
        and fourteen guards as companions. During that time, Pope John Paul II, 
        Archbishop Desmond Tutu and human rights activists from all over the world lobbied the Nigerian
        government for his release.[43] The sole condition attached to the release of Chief Abiola was
        that he renounce his mandate, something that he refused to do, although the military government
        offered to compensate him and refund his extensive election expenses. For this reason 
        Chief Abiola became extremely troubled when Kofi Annan and Emeka Anyaoku reported to the world 
        that he had agreed to renounce his mandate after they met with him to tell him that the world
         would not recognise a five-year-old election.[44][45]</p>
    <h2>Personal life</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Moshood Abiola married many wives;[46][1] notable among them are Simibiat Atinuke Shoaga
         in 1960,[1] Kudirat Olayinka Adeyemi in 1973, Adebisi Olawunmi Oshin in 1974,
         [2] Doyinsola (Doyin) Abiola Aboaba in 1981, Modupe Onitiri-Abiola[4][1]
          and Remi Abiola. He fathered many children.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<hr>
<p>Moshood Abiola died in suspicious circumstances shortly after the death of General Abacha,
     on the day that he was due to be released, 7 July 1998.[47] While the official autopsy stated that Abiola died of natural causes, Abacha's Chief Security Officer, al-Mustapha has alleged that Moshood Abiola was in fact beaten to death. Al-Mustapha, who was detained by the Nigerian government, but later released, claims to have video and audiotapes showing how Abiola was beaten to death. The final autopsy report, which was produced by a group of international coroners has never been publicly released.[48] Regardless of the exact circumstances of his death, it is clear that Chief Abiola received insufficient medical attention for his existing health conditions.

    As recounted at the time in a BBC interview with special envoy Thomas R. Pickering, 
    an American delegation which included Susan Rice visited Abiola;
     during their meeting with him, Abiola fell ill,
     [49] with what was presumed to be a heart attack which caused his death.</p>
    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Moshood Abiola sprang to national and international prominence as a result of his philanthropic 
        activities. The Congressional Black Caucus of the United States of America issued the following 
        tribute to Moshood Abiola:[68]

        Because of this man, there is both cause for hope and certainty that the agony and protests of those who suffer injustice shall give way to peace and human dignity. The children of the world shall know the great work of this extraordinary leader and his fervent mission to right wrong, to do justice, and to serve mankind. The enemies which imperil the future of generations to come: poverty, ignorance, disease, hunger, and racism have each seen effects of the valiant work of Chief Abiola. Through him and others like him, never again will freedom rest in the domain of the few. We, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus salute him this day as a hero in the global pursuit to preserve the history and the legacy of the African diaspora</p>

<h2>Awards and honours</h2>
<hr>
<p>Moshood Abiola was twice voted international businessman of the year,[63] and received numerous honorary doctorates from universities all over the world. In 1987 he was bestowed with the golden key to the city of Washington, D.C., and he was bestowed with awards from the NAACP and the King center in the USA, as well as the International Committee on Education for Teaching in Paris, among many others.

    In Nigeria, the Oloye Abiola was made the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, the highest chieftaincy title available to commoners amongst the Yoruba. At the point when he was elevated, the title had only been conferred by the tribe thirteen times in its long history. This in effect rendered Abiola the ceremonial War Viceroy of all of his tribespeople. According to the folklore of the tribe as recounted by the Yoruba elders, the Aare Ona Kakanfo is expected to die a warrior in the defence of his nation to prove himself in the eyes of both the divine and the mortal as having been worthy of his title.[64][65]
    
    He was posthumously awarded the third highest national honour, the Commander of the Federal Republic, in 1998.[66]
    
    He was also awarded the highest national honor, the Grand Commander of the Federal Republic - or GCFR - in 2018. The date of the annulled election, June 12, was also made Nigeria's Democracy Day.[67]</p>
